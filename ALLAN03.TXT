Tribal tribute

Sculptors captured the screen-accurate details of her skull-like helmet,
and the intricate tooth-like necklace, switches, and other minute parts and pieces that make up the eclectic costume. 
“All those pieces are individually hand sculpted and we try to break those out into different parts so you
get that layering [effect],” Bono says.

The details on the figure and the bike, combined with the larger size and multiple points of articulation, 
make the line unique. “I think it really sets the standard for excellence and accuracy
and innovation as far as really good articulation and the way we brought familiar characters to life in new ways,
” Bono says, noting that recent strides in paint application have 
also made the figures look even more like their real-life counterparts.

And he hopes that as the fifth set in the Black Series line that includes vehicles and creatures, 
the toys will continue to enrich collecting and expand play. “It’s not just figures,” Bono says.
By adding in the vehicles and other accessories, “it’s the whole world of Star Wars” coming into homes in this galaxy.
