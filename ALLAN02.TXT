Since the action figure production schedule is typically 
six months to a full year ahead of a film’s debut, 
the team designing Enfys still knew 
very little about the character when they began sculpting. 
That included the big reveal of the face beneath the mask, 
so this figure, while highly articulated 
and immaculately detailed, 
doesn’t include a removable helmet, Bono says.
To perfect the other details of her ensemble, 
Hasbro sent a designer to the set to sketch out her finished costume, 
which differed from the concept art they had started on.
“We plan for that evolution of design,” Bono says. 
toy designers use actual fabric from costumes 
for comparison or arrive on set armed with Pantone
color books to perfectly match every shade.
